I am interested in program synthesis, verification, and system security. 
My ultimate goal is to build systems that fully automate the program development cycle that encompasses code generation, program testing, and patching.

In the recent days, I am focusing on automatically producing efficient and correct program patches for found bugs.
I hope my work contributes to the community from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
This is why I focus on creating solutions that are scalable and applicable to large, complex programs.

<!-- My recent study was about locating  -->

I am currently working as a security researcher in Republic of Korea Army as part of my military service.
Prior to this, I worked at the [Agency for Defense Development (ADD)](https://https://www.add.re.kr/eps) where I conducted research on the security of allied computer systems and networks.

Aside from my academic pursuits, 
I also enjoy exploring practical techniques called "*Hacking*".
I personally believe that hacking is like comprehensive arts as it requires a deep understanding of diverse fields within computer science.

I earned my M.S. in Information Security from Korea University under the supervision of Prof. Huy Kang Kim, and I received my B.S. in Cyber Defense from Korea University.
